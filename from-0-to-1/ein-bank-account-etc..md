# EIN, Bank Account, etc.

## Get EIN

[Apply for EIN](https://www.irs.gov/businesses/small-businesses-self-employed/apply-for-an-employer-identification-number-ein-online) with the IRS. You need to have a filing receipt to do this, mainly because you need the exact date of formation.

## Other NYS Follow-ups

1. **NYS Tax Department needs your EIN**. For some reason, they have multiple forms in which they notify you of this need. These letters go to your registered agent, who will forward them to you. Whichever on you get, you should follow the instructions there.&#x20;
   * **CT-198** Letter: This one seems to say call them with your EIN.&#x20;
   * **TR-570** Letter. Fill it out and fax it back to them at the number indicated. Or, if you're living dangerously (as I did, unknowingly), upload it to the Dept. of Tax website (you'll have to make yourself a corporate account, which is separate from your business express account). Use the "respond to department notice" feature and select "other notice." Come back later and check that your EIN is correct. _I have heard from a friend that someone at DOT told her you are not actually supposed to upload **this particular notice**. Insert shrug emoji here._
   * **DTF-95** form. [See this item](https://tax.custhelp.com/app/answers/detail/a\_id/1055/kw/tr-570%20instructions/related/1).
2. **Worker's Comp and Disability.** Go back into Business Express and follow the new business checklist - it will tell you to get the Worker's Comp and Disability exception out of the way (if you have **no employees**). May as well do it, because otherwise, they'll just send you letters. You need your EIN for this as well (If you DO have employees, you will have to get worker's comp and disability insurance at this point).

## Get bank account

You will need a separate bank account for your company. I looked into this a good bit, both for cost and options outside traditional banks.

I specifically wanted to use a credit union and I chose to go with the Japanese American Civic League Credit Union ([JACL-CU](https://www.jaclcu.com)), which requires a $70 membership to join the JACL. Apply to JACL-CU after joining JACL (call - it's not obvious online how to do it). They will set you up with a business account. Also, the JACL newsletters are very good.

If being at a credit union isn't important to you, but you don't want a big commercial bank, you could look at [Amalgamated](https://www.amalgamatedbank.com/small-business-checking) or [Carver](https://www.carverbank.com/business-solutions/services) as alternatives. Be forewarned: neither allow business accounts to be opened online. Amalgamated can be done via email (they are very responsive) and Carver requires two in-person visits (the calendar time between visits #1 and #2 can be lengthy).

If you are in a hurry and want to open an account ASAP online, [Novo Bank](https://www.banknovo.com) is a great option (and one that I've now used twice for different reasons).
