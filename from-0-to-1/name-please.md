# Name, Please?

1. **Picking a Name**. I agonize about naming things (or even people) every time I have to do it. In picking a name for a company, though, I've taken comfort in knowing that a name isn't necessarily forever: You can always rebrand with a DBA. With the potential impermanence as a security blanket, I try to think of a name that "makes sense" when you put a one-line description of what the company does after it, so that the reaction is "oh, I get it" when you add a tagline or explain the mission/product.
2. **Check Domain Availability**. You need email and probably a website, so once you have a potential name for your company, it makes sense to see if you can get a domain (xyz.com) that fits it. It seems like all one-word domains in English must already be registered by someone, so you may have to get creative. You can check whether a domain is available by searching on any domain registrar (e.g. [Cloudflare](https://www.cloudflare.com/products/registrar/) or [Google](https://domains.google)). IMHO, shorter is better. For example, if your company's named Exwhyzee Advisors LLC, and exwhyzee-advisors.com and exwhyzee-llc.com are both available, buy both, but use exwhyzee-llc.com (or even xyz-llc.com).
3. **Check Entity Name Availability**. You can't use a name that is already registered in your state or one that is registered nationally for a business that is similar to yours. Before you commit to buying the 5 related domains for your new company name, though, check that the name is available on your State's dept. of Corporations ([New York](https://appext20.dos.ny.gov/corp\_public/corpsearch.entity\_search\_entry) or [Delaware](https://icis.corp.delaware.gov/Ecorp/EntitySearch/NameSearch.aspx), for example). Also check the [US Trademarks Office](https://tmsearch.uspto.gov) for any national registrations.
