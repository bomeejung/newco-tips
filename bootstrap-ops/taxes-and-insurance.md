## Have you heard of PEOs?

In general, for back-office stuff, as soon as you have one employee (so there are two total, you and one other person), you can also look at [the PEO option](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Professional\_employer\_organization). I use a PEO now ([Justworks](https://justworks.com)), primarily to get access to the large employer health plans. I compared several PEOs before selecting Justworks (Paychex, Trinet, ADP, and Sequoia One), and to make a long story short, Justworks is the only one that works with fewer than 5 employees (some of them have a minimum monthly cost equivalent to the per-capita cost of 5 employees, others only offer access to the large employer plans if you have 5 or more people enrolling).

## Business Insurance

There are a lot of helpful (googleable) blog posts and such on this topic. I went with getting coverage from Hiscox through the [Freelancer's Union](https://www.freelancersunion.org/insurance/hiscox-liability/).&#x20;
