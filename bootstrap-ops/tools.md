# Helpful Productivity Tools

## Web Landing Page

There are a lot of no-code website services and I don't know most of them, but I have used [ConvertKit ](https://convertkit.com/features/landing-pages)a couple of times. It's super easy, free, and looks professionally designed (which, technically, it was!). Last I checked, it allowed you to use a custom URL for free, which is a nice benefit.

## Billing and Accounting

1. **Time tracking:** I've used several of these things and I like [Hourstack](https://hourstack.com) and [Clockify](https://clockify.com) because they both let you see you calendar in side-by-side display and you can drag over items from your calendar to log the time (in addition to running a timer, which is a standard feature of other ones like Timular and Tick). Clockify is free.
2. **Invoice presentation**: [Wave](https://www.waveapps.com) is awesome. Easy and fast to make standard "items" that you can add to invoices and send out. It takes care of reminders, and you CAN also use it to accept payments, if you want that. It is also easy to export the ledger at tax time.
3. **Expense Reimbursements**: I've used [Expensify](https://www.expensify.com) for my solo business (just to track the expenses for billing back to a client) and [Airbase](https://www.airbase.com) for my startup (approve expense requests in Slack! Create virtual cards for use with software subscriptions!)

## Email, calendar, file storage, and CRM

In order of importance:

1. Google Workspace: [https://accounts.google.com](https://accounts.google.com) - Email, calendar, file storage.
2. Dashlane: [https://www.dashlane.com](https://www.dashlane.com) for secure passwords. Or use FirstPass. Use something.
3. ****[zCal](https://zcal.co) or [Calendly](http://calendly.com) for self-service calendaring. Cuts down email volume by 50%. Seriously.
4. [Reclaim.ai](https://reclaim.ai) - Keep personal and work calendars synched up. Also does fun auto-scheduling tasks and meetings. This is one of my favorite things ever. Thank you, Internet.
5. CRM: [Hubspot](https://app.hubspot.com) - IMHO, the best of a crowded by not all that satisfactory field. I used Highrise for years and years, and there's nothing as simple and user-friendly as that anymore. Arguably, Copper and Cloze are nice in their own ways, but they all have pros and cons (one of those doesn't allow a contact to have more than one email address - who has only one email address these days?!?)
6. Grasshopper (Virtual PBX): [https://grasshopper.com/](https://grasshopper.com)
7. [GitBook](https://gitbook.com) - turn documents in Github into a nice linked website. You are looking at a GitBook site right now!
8. [Taco](https://tacoapp.com) - see all your tasks (Github, Slack, Google, etc.) in one place

## Meetings and Messaging

1. [Slack](https://slack.com) vs [Teams](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-teams/log-in): I've used both extensively and I have a strong preference for Slack. The integrations are nicer, the difference between the desktop app and the browser app is less annoying, and (this is the killer feature) you can have one-click access to multiple workspaces \*with different email accounts associated.\* <-- this doesn't sound like a problem until it is a problem, and then it is an insurmountable problem. Trust me, you want only ONE account with one email address for Teams.
2. [Zoom](https://zoom.us) vs [Jitsi](https://jitsi.org) vs [Google Meet](https://meet.google.com): I haven't tried Bluejeans (shrug). The main thing to like about Zoom is that it is a desktop app. Browser-based video chats all have similar limitations (you can't switch to a different tab without your video going off, for example), and of course there are integrations for Zoom for various things that aren't available for the browser-based ones. The limitation with Zoom is that you can only have one meeting running at the one time, and sometimes, you want people to be able to get to a meeting without seeing the "host has another meeting underway" message. So I inevitably end up using Zoom for one meeting and either Jitsi or Meet for a meeting that will happen right after the Zoom one, just in case the Zoom one runs long. Jitsi is an open source video chat - it works great, and doesn't depend on you having a google account. The downside, if you want to save recordings, is that it only saves to Dropbox, so you will have to sign up for that, if you want recordings. Google Meet is a good enough video app for most anything (but again, has the in-browser video limitations).
3. [Otter.ai](https://otter.ai) vs [Rewatch](https://rewatch.com) - Otter generates transcripts of meetings from uploaded files, Zoom Pro or Dropbox. The transcription quality is pretty good, and it learns who the voices are. Rewatch also generates transcripts, but rather than keeping only the audio, it keeps the video also. You can do some fun stuff in Rewatch, like create a highlight real easily by highlighting the corresponding text. The quality/accuracy of the transcript is better in Otter than in Rewatch (at the moment - could change!)
