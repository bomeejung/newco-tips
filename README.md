# How to start a solo consulting buisness in NYC

Several people have asked me for tips on how to start an independent consultancy in NYC.
Sharing my personal experience, which should not substitute for professional consultation
with someone who does this for a living, expesically if you have legal questions! 

## Reserving a name and filing with NYS 
1. Pick your entity name that is available for use.
NYS name check website: https://appext20.dos.ny.gov/corp_public/corpsearch.entity_search_entry
Before you decide on the name, check that the URL is available. I use Dreamhost, but you can use any domain registrar to check.
2. Fill out the State's website
https://www.businessexpress.ny.gov/app/answers/cms/a_id/2443/kw/domestic%20LLC
If you don't have a NY.Gov login, it will walk you through getting one, and then once you start the wizard, it takes about 10 minutes.
Before you fill this out, you need to decide what address to use as your primary location of business. If you have family outside of the 5-boroughs that you can be based in, that would save you a lot of money in the required advertisement. You use that as your PHYSICAL address, but not your Address for Service. The address for service is public information that has to be published in the ad (below)
For your Address for Service, choose a registered agent (I used VCorp - they're in the dropdown) and use the same in the next field (Registered Agent)
Cost $225
In about 24 hours, you will get a filing receipt. You have to keep track of this thing. It has the official date your LLC was formed, which you need later

## LLC Public Notice
3. Publish for 6 weeks
Has to run in a daily for 6 weeks and a weekly for 6 weeks.
Whatever county you use, you'll have to look up that county clerk's website to see how they handle the publication.
Just as a reference, in Dutchess, they just list which papers and you contact them directly by email. In Suffolk, they list the papers also, but you have to get a piece of paper from the Clerk, for which you have to pay $35 or something
Contact the papers - they will tell you how much it costs, and you can pay online.
After they run the ads, they will send you a thing that you then have to send into the State

 If you advertise in NYC, just email the county clerk and ask them if they can tell you which papers to advertise in. The Brooklyn Clerk's office was very accommodating. The advert cost was $360 per paper.

Depending on who it is, you may need to send them the advert text. Here is what I used:
~~~
XYZ LLC
XYZ LLC, a domestic LLC, filed with the SSNY on DATE. Office location: NAME County.
SSNY is designated as agent upon whom process against the LLC may be served. SSNY shall mail process to the company c/o: 
VCorp Services, LLC, 25 Robert Pitt Dr., Ste 204, Monsey, NY 10952. 
Purpose: any lawful.
~~~
4.  Whichever registered agent you're using, go register for their service and pay them ASAP. There is a Dept Tax letter headed there. 

## Get EIN
5. Apply for EIN - you need to have the LLS filing receipt to do this

6. (with the EIN in hand) Respond to the NYS Dept Taxation and Finance LLC Request for Information form TR-570. This will just show up at your registered agent, and they will forward it to you, via email if it's VCorp. Fill it out and upload it to the Dept Tax website (you'll have to make yourself a corporate account, which is separate from your business express account). Use the "respond to department notice" feature and select "other notice" No biggie.

7. Go back into Business Express and follow the new business checklist - it will tell you to get the Worker's Comp and Disability exception out of the way. May as well do it, because otherwise, they'll just send you letters. You need your EIN for this as well.

## Get bank account

You will need a separate bank account for your LLC. I looked into this a good bit, both for cost and options outside traditional banks.
I chose to go with the Japanese American Civic League Credit Union, which requires a $70 membership to join the JACL.
Apply to JACL-CU after joining JACL (call  - it's not obvious online how to do it). They will set you up with a business account.
Also, the JACL newsletters are very good. 

If being at a credit union isn't important to you, I recommend Amalgamated or Carver as alternatives.
Be forewarned: Carver requires two in-person visits, and the calendar time between visits #1 and #2 can be lengthly.
Shinhan bank also has a good small business deal, I think, but you have to go in person (32nd and B'way).
