# Taxes, Insurance, etc.

## What about taxes?

For a single member LLC, treat it as a pass-through entity. It doesn't make sense to do it otherwise because the "favorable" tax treatment only really works when you have someone's labor other than your own. From what I've read, even if you take it as profit distribution, you'll be dinged if you ever get audited because all the labor generating the profit is your own. If you learn otherwise from an accountant, let me know!

## Other things to consider

### Have you thought about a duo buisness rather than a solo buisness?

In general, for back-office stuff, as soon as you have one employee (so there are two total, you and one other person), 
you can also look at the PEO option. I looked at the insurance options for one of these for a friend's 30-person nonprofit, 
and they were slightly better than what I get through my husband's multinational (which, admittedly, may not be saying much).
