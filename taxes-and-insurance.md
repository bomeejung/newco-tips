# Taxes, Insurance, etc

## What about taxes?

There are many articles available on this topic via google. If you have an accountant, you may want to consult them at this point.

In my simple case of a single member LLC, I elected to treat it as a pass-through entity, meaning I will just pay income tax on my personal return, rather than having to file a separate return for the company.

As I understand it (again, not an accountant!), the benefit to having it be taxes as a corporation would be that you could take a portion of your earnings as wages and a portion as profit. This only applies if you've got someone else working (employee or 1099 contractor), because any money that is the result of your own labor will be considered wages by the IRS.

## Other things to consider

### Have you thought about a duo business rather than a solo business?

In general, for back-office stuff, as soon as you have one employee (so there are two total, you and one other person), you can also look at [the PEO option](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Professional\_employer\_organization).
